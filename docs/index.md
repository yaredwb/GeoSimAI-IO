### A new paradigm in computational geomechanics

The ability to accomplish tasks via natural language instructions may be one of the most efficient forms of interaction between humans and technology. This efficiency is now evident in practical applications, such as voice-activated virtual assistants and chatbots that assist users based on natural language queries. With ongoing advancements in the field of AI, integrating natural language commands into sophisticated technical fields in science and engineering is becoming increasingly feasible. The emergence of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a pivotal shift in this direction. AutoSimGeo builds on the synergy between traditional simulation tools and the inferential capabilities of LLMs, setting the stage for a revolutionary approach to conducting simulations.
